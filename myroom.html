          <h2>About Jame!</h2>
          <p>James (Jame) is a 20 year old Computer Science major. He plans to graduate and work for an open-source non-profit as a full-stack Software Developer. James believes that open-source software is the only ethical software because people deserve to know how their property works, and what information is being sent or collection by the software they are running. He also believes in helping those who aren’t able to afford software such as the Adobe Suite of software, Microsoft Licenses, or Gsuite products, by using and offering free open-source alternatives such as the KDE Family of programs, GNU/Linux operating systems, or Libreoffice. Outside of his career interests, James is very interested in anything creative or artistic. He knows how to play Clarinet, and is learning how to play Violin. He also enjoys creating 2D artwork, some of which can be seen <a href=https://pf.jameuwu.com/i/web/post/501569058556473355>here!</a> James hopes that one day he will be able to live out his dream of being a helpful member of society who makes software that anyone can use and edit, with a nice lil family in a suburban area outside of a city.

          <h2>About the Website!</h2>
          <p>This website has a bit of an interesting backstory that is made up of a few parts. I'll try to keep it brief. So in 2018 I bought a PC off of eBay to host a Minecraft server on. It was (and to an extent still is) a Minecraft server until my Junior year came around in 2019, when I started thinking about what I should make my Senior quote for the yearbook. There were so many different quotes I could choose from that I had trouble picking one that felt right when suddenly an idea hit me. I could set up a website that serves all of the quotes and put that website in the yearbook. Thus jameuwu.com came to be, and to this day the main landing page has quotes every time you visit. It has taught me quite a lot of skills, especially for concepts such as system administration and web development, as well as the value of open-source software to the world at large. Without this website, if I had never had the idea to make it, I’m not sure I’d be the same person I am today.

          <h2>Beliefs</h2>
          <p>Let me start this section by demonstrating one of my core beliefs. I feel it is extremely important to be able to form your own opinion separate from what others may say or think of you if you really believe in the opinion. However, I also feel it is very important to take into account that other people have opinions too, and being open minded about others opinions, as well as your own is key to being able to understand the people and the world around us. The world is a strange, scary, and ever-evolving place; trying to cling onto your beliefs blindly without even considering what else is out there could be detrimental to your life experience. With that little preface out of the way, allow me to alienate 99.9% of people reading this with my opinions! Firstly- any big tech corporation (or any global for-profit corporation for that matter) is inherently evil. There is no way around that fact, as they cheat, lie and steal their way to the top. Google, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, and many of the beloved brand names that come to mind when you think “technology” only make their profits by using underhanded market techniques such as stealing others work, legally monopolizing a market, abusing their underpaid employees, and selling *you* to other people without your (conscious) consent. The next belief I’ll specify may seem to completely counter argue the last statement so I’ll specify this first: Corporations are not people, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. No one chooses to be evil, cynical, or filled with hatred. People are born into whatever random situation life may have for them, and are forced to figure out the rest on their own. Some people are fortunate and are born into loving nurturing families, with the best genetics on their side. Others may be born without a family at all. The randomness of life creates the people around us, the variations in opinions and emotions. No one really chooses to be who they became, they can only be conscious of who they are and take steps to try and better their current selves if they want to. However, even if they want to be better they are still limited by the skills afforded to them by their current life experience, and their ability to take in new knowledge from the sources around them. Some are not as fortunate as you and I to be able to take in knowledge from the internet and apply it to our real lives, whether it be due to poverty or lack of understanding how technology works. Basically what I’m trying to say is, be nice to people. You never know what has happened to a person in their lifetime, and while nothing should be an excuse for someone to act like a dick, maybe a bit of kindness in their life will set them free and help them come back to the kind path we all should be walking. The last belief I’ll share is that everyone deserves to live fulfilling lives. No one deserves to be left in the dark. No one deserves to suffer just because of a disease, the color of their skin, or their beliefs. Every human life is something that can only be experienced by that person, and only by that person once. It is unfair that a large amount of people are only suffering because of greed and selfishness. Do yourself a favor today, and give yourself permission to be okay. Give yourself permission to enjoy this moment, and love yourself. Life is hard, but hopefully with enough people like myself, and maybe like you as well if you agree with me, we can all come together and leave the world a better place than when we started.</p>
